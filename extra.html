    <h1>Extra</h1>
    <p>For my something extra I looked into Bootstrap and LottieFiles.com. 
        I knew a bit about BootStrap but I wanted to see how it would work with an EC2 instance.
        I also have always wanted to add animations to a website and so I did research on LottieFiles.
        I wanted to see if I could get the animations to work.
